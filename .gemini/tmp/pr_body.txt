Closes #1

This pull request addresses Issue #1, "Implement Authentication".

Upon investigation, it was found that the authentication system using Firebase/OAuth was already fully implemented and integrated into the application:
- Firebase initialization and `auth` service setup in `src/lib/firebase.ts`.
- Authentication logic with Google OAuth and state management in `src/components/AuthContext.tsx`.
- Login/Logout UI in `src/app/page.tsx`.
- `AuthProvider` wrapping the application in `src/app/layout.tsx`.

The existing implementation was verified to be functional. This PR serves to close Issue #1 and confirm the completion of this feature.
